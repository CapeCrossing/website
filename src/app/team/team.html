<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>
The principals at Tri-Star Development Partners bring a complete and diverse set of experience and skills to the real estate industry. We are not only developers but also real estate investors and contractors, as well. This makes for a powerful collaboration as projects have needs for financing, engineering, construction management and navigation of jurisdictional permits and approvals.
</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Services</h3>
<p>
Additionally, projects require strategic planning, marketing, administration and legal oversight. Our team delivers this comprehensive package of services. Plus, our professional advisors consist of an attorney with vast experience in real estate and investor relations and a CPA with proven skills to develop and guide financial strategies that mesh with investment legal strategies.
</p>
<h3>An Eye on Rebuilding the Future</h3>
<p>
Tri-Star is also one of the few organizations that will work with severely distressed properties and re-direct them into becoming strong, performing assets. Projects can be distressed from a vast array of problems which may include: permitting, structural, environmental, marketing and more often than not, financing stresses. As investors, and managers of investments from others, Tri-Star has a unique capability to overcome hurdles and salvage projects to everyone’s benefit.
</p>
<h3>Project Diversity</h3>
<p>
Tri-Star seeks to find real estate opportunities of all kinds and to assist investment groups with their development projects. We are adept at providing our skills to whatever needs a project may have. Investors, owners, contractors and communities can feel confident that Tri-Star Development Partners will provide all the components necessary for a successful project.
