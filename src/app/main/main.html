						The best way to experience the ultimate in waterfront, resort-living is to be a part of it. Take ownership of this fun-loving lifestyle and have the option to receive a return on your investment.

				<p>
				Resort and waterfront living become one in the community of Cape Crossing; an exciting new development on Merritt Island, designed for relaxation and a multitude of <a ui-sref='lifestyle'>outdoor activities.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
				This is the perfect home away from home — for a winter retreat or family vacation any time. Owners taking advantage of our <a ui-sref='rental'>rental program</a>, enjoy income from nightly and weekly rentals. We take care of everything from marketing and management, to housekeeping and maintenance. <a ui-sref='contact'>Contact us</a> to learn more. . .

				<h4>
						So plan your escape to old-style-Florida-living — for individuals, couples and families, where fun is our main priority.
				</h4>
				<p>
				This exciting new resort development is <a ui-sref='location'>located</a> on the site of the historic former home of The Tingley RV Park and Marina; a Merritt Island landmark for more than 50 years. Patrons could get “the best hamburger in town” and neighbors bumped elbows at Friday night fish frys.
				</p>
				<p>
Just as the Tingley family inspired patrons, we want to carry on the tradition of serving-up delicious food in our restaurant and bar, where families and friends can share good times and create new memories that harken back to simpler days on the island.
				</p>
				<p>
				We aim to create beautiful public spaces within the community that elevate the experience of a <a ui-sref='residences'>waterfront living</a> vacation to a thrilling new level, bringing an “old-style Florida Keys” relaxation to your own back yard.
