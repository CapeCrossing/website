  				<h1>Our Little Piece of Paradise and Surrounding Attractions</h1>
  					<p>
  Cape Crossing is nestled in a serene location on the northwest side of Merritt Island between the Indian River directly to the west, and the Banana River to the east, on the Canaveral “Barge” Canal “water bridge” offering direct access to both rivers, intracoastal waterway, Port Canaveral and the Atlantic Ocean. Some may remember this site as Tingley’s Marina.
  					</p>
  					<p>
	It gets even better if you value convenience of travel by air or sea. There are no stoplights between us and Orlando International Airport, and Port Canaveral is only moments away.
