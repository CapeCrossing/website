  				<h1>Our Little Piece of Paradise and Surrounding Attractions</h1>
  					<p>
  Cape Crossing is nestled in a serene location on the northwest side of Merritt Island between the Indian River directly to the west, and the Banana River to the east, on the Canaveral Barge Canal water bridge, offering direct access to both rivers, intracoastal waterway, Port Canaveral and the Atlantic Ocean. Some may remember this site as Tingley’s Marina.
  					</p>
  					<p>
	It gets even better if you value convenience of travel by air or sea. There are no stoplights between us and Orlando International Airport. Plus, Port Canaveral is only moments away.

		This land has a story to tell, and if you listen closely you can hear it when the breeze rustles through the mangroves and ripples across the water. It shares the stories of the people who lived here long ago, feeding their families from the richness of the land and water.
		</p>
		<p>
		According to Vernon Lamme, one of the first Florida archaeologists and an early homesteader of Merritt Island in 1912, he wrote in his book Florida Lore, Not Found In History Books that “the Indian River was saltier than the seas and teeming with fish, and the Caribbean pine trees on Merritt Island stood so close to each other, a two-wheeled cart drawn by 4 yoke of oxen could make no road through them — many were five feet in diameter and it was almost impossible to drive a nail into the lumber until it was seasoned.”
		</p>
		<p>
		“Magnificent flocks of pink curlews (Roseate Spoonbills) could be found in the lagoons. Nearly every homesteader boasted of a bald eagle's nest on his property. And a little farther south were the egrets, millions of them, although the hunters even then were thinning out the flocks to adorn the society ladies millinery with their plumes.”
